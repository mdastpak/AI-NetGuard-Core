## Development Workflow

### Updating Prompts

The prompts are maintained in a separate repository as a read-only submodule. To update to the latest prompts:

```bash
git submodule update --remote
```

**Important:** Do not modify files in the `prompts/` directory directly. All changes to prompts should be made in the main [AI-NetGuard](https://github.com/mdastpak/AI-NetGuard) repository.
